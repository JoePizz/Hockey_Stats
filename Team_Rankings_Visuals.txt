<p>The raw scores used from this project are from https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2022_games.html<p>

<p>The aim of this model is to give us more accurate team rankings than the widely used metrics of team points or points percentage.
<p>This algorithm used to model these rankings is called the "Adjusted plus/minus rating system." It utilizes the score differential of each team's games played as well as whether the team was home or away.<p>
